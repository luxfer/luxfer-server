# luxfer-server

The server runs the Game of Life algorithm and allows user to change its behavior.

The server is a part of the "Mystic Wall" installation realized in 2015 by Matúš Buranovský, Adam Heinrich and Jan Husák during the ITT course held by the [Institute of Intermedia](http://iim.cz) at the [Czech Technical University in Prague](http://cvut.cz).
